Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Name:
 AI Recruitment Agent
Project Overview:
 AI Recruitment Agent is an autonomous, multi-agent platform that automates job discovery, intelligence enrichment, candidate-job matching, and personalized outreach for recruitment. The system dramatically increases speed, accuracy, and scale in talent matching—giving recruiters and candidates a major competitive advantage.

1. Goals & Objectives
Automate job discovery across major job boards, company career sites, and social media.


Enrich job listings with actionable details (role, company intel, hiring manager contacts).


Match pre-qualified candidates to job opportunities using AI-powered scoring.


Send personalized outreach campaigns via email/LinkedIn for top matches.


Provide a real-time dashboard for tracking, analytics, and system controls.



2. Core Features
A. Parallel Job Discovery
Multiple agents crawl job boards (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, AngelList, startups, niche job boards) and social media for fresh job postings.


High-frequency scans (every few minutes).


Stealth agent detects unadvertised openings via company signals.


B. Intelligence Enrichment
Extract details: company size, funding, tech stack, culture, role requirements.


Discover and validate direct contacts via APIs (Apollo.io, Snov.io).


Prioritize jobs by urgency signals (reposts, growth pulse).


C. Candidate-Job Matching
Load 20-30 ready candidate profiles (skills, experience, preferences, location, salary).


AI matching engine scores each job-candidate pair; filters and ranks only top (≥75%) matches.


D. Automated Outreach
Multi-touch campaigns (emails, LinkedIn) with dynamic messaging and follow-ups.


Personalization engine pulls recent company news, candidate fit, and customizes tone.


Tracks responses, automates scheduling/interviews.


E. Command Center Dashboard
Job/candidate feed, outreach stats, response rates, interview pipeline, ROI.


Reporting: daily, weekly, custom analytics.

LinkedIn automation (PhantomBuster, Dripify)


F. DevOps
Dockerized services (frontend, backend-node, backend-python)


Orchestrated with Docker Compose (docker-compose-dev.yml)


Environment variables for secrets and cloud connection strings



4. Use Cases
Recruiter wants fresh, pre-validated job matches for top candidates


Candidate gets high-quality, fast job outreach


Admin monitors pipeline, campaign effectiveness, and system health


AI system learns which job boards, messaging, or times yield the best results



5. Workflow Example
Recruiter/admin inputs candidate profiles and target job titles.


Discovery agents scan platforms, enrich job posts and contacts.


AI matcher recommends best job-candidate pairs.
