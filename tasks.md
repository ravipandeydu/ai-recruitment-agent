Here is a strategic plan to distribute the work among your three members: **Member A (Backend & Infrastructure)**, **Member B (Data & AI)**, and **Member C (Outreach & Frontend)**.

### **Phase 1: Foundation (The Discovery Engine)**

The goal here is to get the data pipeline running. The work can be split so that infrastructure is built while the data agents are being developed in parallel.

* **Member A (Backend & Infrastructure):**
    * [cite_start]Set up the core infrastructure: Choose and deploy **LangGraph/n8n** for workflow orchestration[cite: 164].
    * [cite_start]Create the private **GitHub repository** and establish branching strategies[cite: 272, 284].
    * [cite_start]Design and set up the **database schema** to store jobs, companies, and candidates[cite: 167, 278].
    * [cite_start]Build the **queue management system** for processing jobs discovered by the agents[cite: 126].

* **Member B (Data & AI):**
    * [cite_start]Build the first two web scraping agents (e.g., **LinkedIn Jobs Agent**, **Indeed Scraper Agent**) using tools like Puppeteer or Playwright[cite: 129, 165].
    * [cite_start]Develop the initial **job parsing logic** using NLP to extract requirements and details from the raw data gathered by the agents[cite: 136, 166].

* **Member C (Outreach & Frontend):**
    * [cite_start]Build the third agent, focusing on an API-based one for quicker integration (e.g., **Google Jobs API Agent**)[cite: 26, 165].
    * Begin wireframing the **Real-Time Command Center** dashboard. [cite_start]Designing the UI early is crucial[cite: 91, 278].
    * [cite_start]Start the initial setup and research for the **email automation system**[cite: 141].

### **Phase 2: Intelligence (Enrichment and Matching)**

With job data flowing in, the focus shifts to enriching it and building the core matching logic.

* **Member A (Backend & Infrastructure):**
    * Develop the backend API endpoints that will be needed to connect the database to the frontend dashboard.
    * Assist Member B with the backend logic for integrating the external APIs.

* **Member B (Data & AI):**
    * [cite_start]Integrate the **Apollo.io/Snov.io APIs** to enrich job data with contact information for hiring managers[cite: 170].
    * [cite_start]Develop the core **AI Matching Engine**, creating the algorithm to score and rank candidates against job opportunities[cite: 171, 172].
    * [cite_start]Integrate **GPT-4** to generate personalized content for email templates[cite: 138, 173].

* **Member C (Outreach & Frontend):**
    * [cite_start]Begin building the frontend of the **analytics dashboard** based on the designs from Phase 1[cite: 184].
    * Develop the system that will take the personalized templates from Member B and prepare them for the outreach campaigns.

### **Phase 3: Orchestration (Outreach Automation)**

This phase is about activating the communication channels.

* **Member A (Backend & Infrastructure):**
    * [cite_start]Build the backend logic for the **follow-up sequences** (e.g., timing emails for T+3 days, T+7 days)[cite: 71, 72, 178].
    * [cite_start]Implement the **response tracking** mechanism to log replies from recruiters[cite: 179].

* **Member B (Data & AI):**
    * Refine the matching algorithm based on initial test data.
    * [cite_start]Start building the remaining discovery agents to increase the volume of job opportunities[cite: 182].

* **Member C (Outreach & Frontend):**
    * [cite_start]Build the **email campaign system** to send the automated outreach[cite: 176].
    * [cite_start]Add the **LinkedIn automation** component, ensuring it operates within platform limits[cite: 142, 177].
    * Connect the frontend dashboard to the backend APIs created by Member A.

### **Phase 4: Optimization (Scale and Improve)**

The final phase focuses on scaling, deploying, and building the feedback loops that make the system smarter.

* **Member A (Backend & Infrastructure):**
    * [cite_start]Manage the **final deployment** of the application to a live, public URL[cite: 288, 337].
    * [cite_start]Ensure all security measures are in place, such as not having hardcoded credentials[cite: 318].
    * [cite_start]Perform final testing and bug fixes[cite: 289].

* **Member B (Data & AI):**
    * [cite_start]Implement the **A/B testing framework** to test different message templates and subject lines[cite: 77, 183].
    * [cite_start]Work with Member A to implement robust **error handling and retry logic** for all the agents[cite: 127].

* **Member C (Outreach & Frontend):**
    * [cite_start]Complete the **analytics dashboard**, ensuring all metrics are displayed correctly[cite: 184].
    * [cite_start]Create the final presentation slides, README.md documentation, and a backup demo video as specified in the deliverables[cite: 339, 344, 345].

By splitting the work this way, you create three streams of development that can progress in parallel, significantly speeding up your timeline. [cite_start]Remember to use feature branches for development and to commit your code often to stay synchronized[cite: 283, 284].
